\chapter{Timeline}


I plan to spend the beginning of term one working on my project plan and deciding on the technologies and frameworks that I will be using. Then I will start building my application, I will be focusing on the Web and Application tier's as the data model will be defined based on them. I am hoping to have an Minimum viable product (MVP) by the end of week 8 so that I have time to test it and create my interim report by the end of week 10. After the report is submitted and I have completed the presentation I am planning to re-evaluate my plan for term 2, I am also planning to do a review in week 6 to ensure that I am on track and to help me prioritise work.
