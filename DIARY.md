# Final Year Project Diary


## Week 1

- I met with my supervisor to discuss what the project entails and to also discuss my initial plan. 
- I am struggling to decide on what product I want to build but I am thinking about creating a store application that allows for individual users, teams and enterprise users.
- I have been researching technologies that I am planning on using both now and In the future.
- After researching the technologies I wanted to use I found some issues with how to test them so I am evaulating what would be the best option, I also asked my supervisor what they thought would be a good approach, with the advice I got and the research I completed I will be able to narrow down what to use.
- Finally I have been working on my project plan and have started the abstract, created an intial timeline and started thinking about the risks my project has.

## Week 2

- I continued working on my project plan, I had some areas where I was unsure so I asked my supervisor to read over one of my drafts. 
- I continued to research web technologies and I am planning on setting up the initial application.
- I updated my plan based on the recomendations I recieved and finished it off. 
- I submitted the project plan and merged it into the main branch of this repo as well as creating a tag for it so that I can easily track when it was completed. 
- I had planned on setting up the intial application and I will have some of it set up but it will be hard to fully understand the requirments until my project plan has been marked and I have some feedback on it.

## Week 3

- I spent the majority of this week planning and researching.
- I have decided to use a Java Spring boot application with a PostgreSQL database for the backend and a Typescript Next.js Frontend.
- I created an initial setup for both the frontend and backend and I plan to continue working on the setup over the next week.
- I did lots of research on all of these frameworks as well as authentication providers and payment providers. 

## Week 4 

- I setup the authentication provider that I am planning to use. To do this I used the research I did on AWS Cognito and Terraform so that I could provision it using Infrastructure as Code. 
- I also setup apollo client on the frontend which I will use to manage the states of my data and interact with the backend of the application. 
- Finally I setup graphql codegen which will enable me to generate type safe code from my graphql schema. 


## Week 5 

- I setup authentication on the frontend which now allows for a user to login if they have a cognito user account. 
- I then setup the use of JWT for authorisation. This was only setup to send the JWT to the backend. 
- I started adding JWT verification on the backend but I started getting lots of issues with CORS once I added spring security. This meant that the issue is rolling over into Week 6.
