# Final Year Project Diary


## Week 1

- I met with my supervisor to discuss what the project entails and to also discuss my initial plan. 
- I am struggling to decide on what product I want to build but I am thinking about creating a store application that allows for individual users, teams and enterprise users.
- I have been researching technologies that I am planning on using both now and In the future.
- After researching the technologies I wanted to use I found some issues with how to test them so I am evaulating what would be the best option, I also asked my supervisor what they thought would be a good approach, with the advice I got and the research I completed I will be able to narrow down what to use.
- Finally I have been working on my project plan and have started the abstract, created an intial timeline and started thinking about the risks my project has.
