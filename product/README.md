# Documents 

This directory contains all of the code for the application, it is split up into [frontend](/product/frontend/), [backend](/product/backend/) and [infrastructure](/product/infrastructure/). Each of these sections will be further divided as needed, but this provides a good initial separation.

## Dependencies

This product is dependent on [AWS Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/what-is-amazon-cognito.html), to set it up you can follow this [README.md](./infrastructure/README.md) and there will be steps to set it up in the guide in my project.
